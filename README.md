This website uses Google Gemini to generate a vacation plan based on the location/s, duration, types of places you are interested in exploring, and number of people on the trip.
To run locally, run `python3 -m http.server` in the terminal and see the website at http://localhost:8000/. To use Google Gemini in this application, it's necessary to create a file called `api_key.js` which contains the line `export const apiKey = {your API key as a string};`.
